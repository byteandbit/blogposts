MageStackDay is an online hackathon dedicated to answering, closing and cleaning up questions on [magento.stackexchange.com](https://magento.stackexchange.com/) & [Magento community forum](https://community.magento.com/). 

The goal will be to get the answered questions rate up and get more users active on this platform. In the end it is all about getting together online and enjoying the best thing about Magento: [the community](https://twitter.com/hashtag/realmagento)!
